Battleship Project for The Odin Project ‚öîÔ∏èüö¢
Welcome to my Battleship game project, developed as part of The Odin Project's curriculum! This project has been an incredible learning experience, helping me solidify my understanding of test-driven development (TDD) using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing library.

Project Overview
In this Battleship game, I've had the opportunity to implement the classic board game where the player position their fleets of ships and attempt to locate and sink the opponent's (computer) ships. This project has emphasized the importance of writing tests before implementing the actual functionality, following the principles of TDD.

Learning Objectives
Working on this project has allowed me to:

Gain hands-on experience in implementing a JavaScript application using TDD.
Understand the importance of writing tests to guide the development process.
Enhance my problem-solving skills by tackling the challenges of game logic and user interactions.
Technologies Used
I've used the following technologies for this project:

JavaScript: I implemented the project using JavaScript to create the game logic and interactivity.
Jest: Test-driven development was facilitated by Jest, a testing framework for JavaScript. I wrote tests to guide the development process and ensure the reliability of my code.
